### Part 2 (75 pts)

First, I would tell my boss. Since they are my superior, and have most likely worked at the company for longer, there is a decent chance they have more experience, or at least knowledge of the proper way to approach the situation. This would also be a good way to pass some of the responsibility onto somebody else. It's most likely company protocol to report to someone higher up when you encounter an issue and don't know what to do. All in all, I feel like this is the safest thing to do first. 

To put my subsequent answers into perspective, I'm going to answer the question of responsibility first: Yes, everyone with knowledge of a bug is responsible in some way for any harm that it causes. Responsibility, of course, doesn't just fall on a single person, but in a situation that could endanger lives, inaction is action. Refusing to do anything speaks just as loudly as any other option. Sometimes life sucks, sometimes problems are thrown into your lap that you want nothing to do with or are not equipped to handle - but once they are there, they are there, and refusal to act is not immunity from blame. Whether they like it or not, from the coders to the product testers to anyone else in the company that knows about the bug, this is their responsibility to handle. Walking away, although an option, is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.

If my boss doesn't do anything or tells me to keep my mouth shut, then I would have to take other action. I believe not disclosing the vulnerability is the wrong decision because it is almost guaranteed that someone will find and take advantage of it. The slide in class demonstrated just how fast hackers can act. In a best-case scenario, the company would be able to delay the release until the bug is fixed. If not, I would try to disclose publicly that the vehicles were unsafe. Hopefully it would be possible to do this anonymously. I think the public disclosure would force the company to act and it would also give the users of the automobile a warning. I don't think that, in terms of attackers, there would be a big difference between disclosing and not. I might lose my job but that would probably be better than having somebody's death on my conscience.
